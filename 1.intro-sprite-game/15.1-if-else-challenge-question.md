## Problem #1: Rain or Shine

Translate the following statements into a program that tells the user a clothing choice.

* Use a variable `temp` for the temperature
* Use a boolean (`True` / `False`) variable `is_raining` for whether or not it is raining.
* Use a variable `clothing_choice` to store the right clothing choice.

If the temperature is less than 30 degrees, then I wear my winter coat. Otherwise, if it is raining, I wear my rain jacket. In all other cases, Iâ€™ll just wear a sweatshirt.

Print out the clothing choice with `print()`
