# Repl Puzzles 30-35 Instructions

Work on Repl coding puzzles 30-35. You should be up to 30 now. If not, continue where you left off. There is no new code that we didn't cover before we left. Each of the 30-35 will be graded under our new system (0,1,2)

**If you are done with your Repl assignments, there are a few of you already there. Practice by building this Turtle Race:

*NEED HELP?*
If you are stuck on how to do something, here are the steps you are going to follow:

Step 1: Google it/YouTube it: This leads you to take responsibility over the problem. Googling something is how I get through most of my problems and learn new tech.

Step 2: Post your problem as a reply to the lesson's thread on Google Hangouts Chat. This will ask your peers for help. There are 22 of you and 1 of me. If we help each other not as teacher-students but as all of us together have something to learn and teach, we all can be more productive. If you see a question, respond to it if you know the answer. If not, I will get back to it when I see it.
